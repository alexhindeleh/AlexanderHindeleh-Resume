        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a 4th-year Biology major and Business Administration minor at the University of California, Riverside. Throughout my time at UC Riverside, I have gained a passion for biomedical research, specifically in the field of neuropharmacology and addiction sciences. My experience in Dr. Natalie Zlebnik's laboratory at the UCR School of Medicine has solidified my interests, giving me direct experience in fiber photometry analysis, mouse colony handling and management, and Scope data analysis. Previously, I was an undergraduate researcher in the Zhou laboratory at the UCR School of Medicine, where I researched molecular mechanisms of cardiometabolic diseases, specifically atherosclerosis. I learned how to handle mice, as well as perform surgeries, in addition to molecular biology techniques rangin from DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, qPCR, and gel electrophoresis. These two research experiences have given me a new perspective on the field of biomedical sciences, furthering my interest in pursuing a PhD in the field. Following my PhD, I hope to work in the biotechnology venture capital industry, to further support start-ups that are bringing life-saving medications to market. My specific interests within the biotechnology industry include precision medicine, oncology, and cardiology advancements. I hope to be at the forefront of this industry, and in a position where I can understand the innerworkings of start-up pharmaceutical companies. Outside of my research interests, I am also a Financial Operations and Data Analytics intern at the UC Riverside School of Medcine, where I process financial reports, encumberances, and other documents for the financial operations team. I also help with data analysis procedures, ranging from generating reports on patient satisfaction, physician wait times, and other relevant clinical metrics. This experience has showed me the innerworkings of healthcare systems, particularly working in an underserved region such as the Inland Empire, where primary care physicians are neededa at alarming rates. Learning how to better support patients, whether through improving already existing healthcare systems, or implementing new strategies, has ignited my passion for improving healthcare through the biotechnology industry. I also want to be involved in science communication efforts across the globe in order to make science more accessible to those without formal training in the sciences. In my experiences in the Mini Medical School program at the UCR School of Medicine, I have learned how to create digestible, easy-to-understand informational brochures and presentations about skin cancer for people without backgrounds in science.This has shown me the importance of outreach in the community, and letting people know what precautions they can take to better their health .Aside from my professional interests, some of my hobbies include traveling, trying new cafes, playing tennis, and more recently painting with my friends. Tennis has been a huge part of my life since I was in elementary school, as it taught me how to be competitive and a team player at the same time. That is the philosophy that I hold throughout my life,in that some friendly competition is helpful for advancing yourself and others, but it's always important to be a team player. I am always looking for new hobbies or activities to try out, so let me know of any that you love!  <br><br>
